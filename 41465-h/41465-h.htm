<h3>
<span>LORD KING, THE SCLATERS, DR. KELLET, ETC.</span>
</h3>

<p><cite>The Original Draught of the Primitive Church</cite>, 8vo. Lond. 1717, written
in reply to <cite>An Inquiry into the Constitution and Discipline of the
Primitive Church</cite>, by Mr. Peter King, afterwards Lord Chancellor [from
1725 to 1733], and Baron King of Ockham, is usually attributed to Mr.
William Sclater. Respecting this writer, whose work attained and has
preserved considerable celebrity, and respecting others of his name, I
forward some Notes which I have met with, and beg anxiously to solicit
others from your correspondents.</p>

<p>In Lathbury's <cite>History of the Nonjurors</cite>, cap. vii. p. 303., he is thus
mentioned:</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "Sclater at length stepped forth [to reply to King's <cite>Inquiry</cite>],
   and it is said that King was not only convinced by his arguments,
   but that he made him an offer of a living in the Church of
   England. Sclater was a nonjuring clergyman; consequently he could
   not accept preferment in the Anglican Church, which involved the
   taking the oath of allegiance. All the arguments in King's book
   were considered with the greatest candour and ability. The author
   was a man of singular modesty, of unaffected piety, and of
   uncommon learning, of which this work affords abundant evidence."</p>

<p>Dr. Hinds, the present Bishop of Norwich, in his <cite>History of the Rise
and early Progress of Christianity</cite>, Preface, page xv., 1st edit., thus
speaks:</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "Lord King wrote his once celebrated <cite>Inquiry</cite> in an honest and
   candid spirit, as the result testifies; but his research was
   partial, and led him to adopt the congregational principle of the
   Independents. In Mr. Sclater's reply, principles scarcely less
   erroneous may be pointed out; yet, as far as the controversy
   went, he was right, and his opponent, by an act of candour
   perhaps unexampled, acknowledged himself convinced, and gave
   Sclater preferment for his victory."</p>

<p>Lord Campbell, however, in his <cite>Lives of the Chancellors</cite>, vol. iv. p.
369., discredits the idea of this conversion. He says:</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "This work [the <cite>Inquiry</cite>] made a great sensation, passed through
   several editions, and called forth many learned and able answers,
   particularly one by a nonjuring clergyman of the name of Sclater,
   which is said (<em>I believe without authority</em>) even to have made a
   convert of King himself."<a id="Page_458"></a> <span class="pagenum">[458]</span></p>

<p>These are the only notices of Sclater which have fallen in my way.<a id="way1"></a><a title="Go to footnote 1." href="#fn1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> I
should remark, that his <cite>Original Draught</cite> is anonymous. He merely
styles himself "a Presbyter of the Church of England."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn1"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#way1" class="label">[1]</a> [We have met with two other accounts of the Chancellor's
      conversion, both varying in a few particulars with the extracts given by
      our correspondent. Archdeacon Daubeny, in his work on <cite>Schism</cite>, p. 235.,
      says, "Lord Chancellor King was at one time of his life so determined an
      advocate for Presbyterianism, and considered himself so perfectly
      acquainted with the merits of that subject, that he published a book
      upon it. To this book an answer was written by one Sclater, a clergyman,
      under the title of <cite>A Draught of the Primitive Church</cite>, which brought
      the point at issue within a short compass, and decided it in the most
      satisfactory manner. This book the author did not live to publish. It
      happened, however, that the author's manuscript after his death, came
      into the hands of the Lord Chancellor, who was so perfectly satisfied
      with its contents, that he published Sclater's manuscript at his own
      expense, as the strongest proof that could be given to the world of the
      alteration of his own views on the subject in question." The other
      version occurs in the <cite>Gentleman's Mag.</cite> for Oct. 1792, p. 910.:&mdash;"There
      is a circumstance relating to Lord King's book, and Mr. Sclater's answer
      to it, very little known, but which to me comes vouched with
      unquestionable authenticity. Before Mr. Sclater's book was published, it
      was read in manuscript by Lord King himself, it having been seized,
      among other papers, in the house of Mr. Nathanael Spinkes, a Nonjuring
      bishop, and carried to Lord King, then Chancellor, who very politely
      returned it, confessing that it was a very sufficient confutation of
      those parts of his book which it undertook to answer; that it was
      written with equal Christian temper and moderation, and unanswerable
      strength of argument; and desiring or consenting that it might be
      published."&mdash;E<span class="smcap lowercase">D.</span>]</p>


<p>Of another William Sclater I find two notices in <cite>Miscellanies of
Divinitie divided into three Books, by Edvvard Kellet, Doctour of
Divinitie, and one of the Canons of the Cathedrall Church of Exon</cite>, fol.
Cambridge, 1635:</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "Melchisedec was a figure of Christ, and tithes by an everlasting
   law were due to the priesthood of Melchisedec, as is unanswerably
   proved by my reverend friend (now a blessed saint, Doctor
   Sclater), against all sacrilegious church-robbers."</p>

    <p class="author1">B. i. c. v.    p. 83.</p>


<p>Again:</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "When that man of happy memory, the late right Reverend, now most
   blessed Saint, Arthur Lake, Lord Bishop of Bath and Wells [from
   1616 to 1626], appointed Doctour Sclater (now also a saint in
   Heaven, then my most loving friend, and sometime fellow-collegian
   in the two royall colledges at Eaton and Cambridge) with myself
   to confer with an Anabaptisticall woman, we heard her determine
   great Depths of Divinitie as confidently as ever St. Paul did,
   though he was taught by Christ himself, and as nimbly as ever an
   ape crackt nuts," &amp;c. </p>

   <p class="author1"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ibid.</i> c. viii. p. 151.</p>

<p>This Dr. William Sclater, then, was of Eton, and Fellow of King's
College; was the author of a work on Tithes; and probably beneficed in
the diocese of Bath and Wells during the episcopate of Lake, who
preceded Laud in that see. To him also we may probably ascribe <cite>The
Exposition on the first three Chapters of Romans</cite>, published by a person
of this name in 1611. As in 1635 he is spoken of as dead, he could, if
connected at all with the author of <cite>The Original Draught</cite>, hardly have
been his father. He may have been his grandfather.</p>

<p>There is another Sclater, who may have been father of Lord King's
opponent,&mdash;Dr. Edward Sclater, who in 1686 published <cite>Consensus Veterum;
or the Reasons for his Conversion to the Catholic Faith</cite>. He was
incumbent of Esher and of Putney, and, as such, obtained a curious
dispensation from all pains, penalties, and forfeitures of non-residence
on his benefices, accompanied by a license to keep a school, and to take
"boarders, tablers, or sojourners," direct from the king, James II. This
document may be found in Gutch's <cite>Collectanea Curiosa</cite>, No. 36., vol. i.
p. 290.; and the concurrence of its date (May 3, 1686) with that of the
<cite>Reasons for his Conversion</cite> is of ominous significancy. In 1687 he
published another work, entitled <cite>The Primitive Fathers no Protestants</cite>;
to which Edward Gee replied in his <cite>Primitive Fathers no Papists</cite>, in
1688. Several other tracts, addressed by Gee to this convert to the
religion of the sovereign, show that there must have been a smart and
long-continued controversy between them.<a id="them2"></a><a title="Go to footnote 2." href="#fn2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn2"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#them2" class="label">[2]</a> [On the 5th of May, 1689, being Rogation Sunday,
      Dr. Edward Sclater made a public recantation of
      the Romish religion, and was readmitted into the
      bosom of the English Church, in the chapel at the

<p>Dr. Edward Kellet is mentioned by Wood, in <cite>Fasti Oxonienses</cite>, anno
1616, as rector of Ragborough and Croscombe, in Somersetshire. There is
no place in Somersetshire of the former name, but there is one which
bears the latter. I conceive, therefore, this to be a misprint for
<em>Bagborough</em> and <em>Crowcombe</em>, parishes nearly contiguous in the western
part of the county.</p>

<p>The <cite>Gentleman's Magazine</cite> for February 1841 contains a notice of a work
by Edward Kellet, entitled <cite>Tric&oelig;nium Christi in nocte proditionis
su√¶: The Threefold Supper of Christ</cite>, &amp;c.: folio, Lond. 1641. His
antipathy to tobacco must have been worthy of that of good King James
himself; for,<a id="Page_459"></a> <span class="pagenum">[459]</span> starting from the Feast of the Passover, he
delivers the following violent counter-blast against the weed, and those
who use it:</p>

<p class="blockquot">    "The earth, ayre, and water afford not enough for their gluttony,
   and though sawcy Art second Nature, nor eye nor desire is
   satisfyed: the creatures groane under this grosse abuse: these
   are swinish Epicures, prodigal consumers of God's blessings.
   Tobacco, the never unseasonable Tobacco, the all-usefull Tobacco,
   good for meate, drinke, and cloathing; good for cold, heate, and
   all diseases, this must sharpen their appetites before meate,
   must heate it at their meate, being the only curious antepast,
   sauce, and post-past; wine and beere must wash downe the stenche
   of that weede, and it again must dry up their moyst fumes."</p>

<h3>
<span>PASSAGE FROM DOVER TO CALAIS.</span>
</h3>


<p>The charge for conveyance of passengers between Dover and Calais was
fixed by a statute made in the fourth year of the reign of Edward III.,
<span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 1330, at sixpence for a foot passenger, and two shillings for a man
and horse, as may be seen in the following extract from this statute:</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "Item. Com avant ces heures homme a cheval soleit aver son
   passage de la meer a port de Dovre pur ii, <i>s.</i> et homme apee pur
   vi, <i>d.</i> et ore denovel ont les gardiens de passage et passagers
   pris plus a grande damage de <a id="ple"></a>poeple; Si est accorde que en dit
   port et touz autres, et auxint en touz les autres passages de la
   terre, auxibien en ewes douces, come en braz de meer, les
   passauntz paient desore come ancienement soleint, et de plus ne
   soient charges, ne les passagers ne gardiens des passages nient
   plus ne preignent."</p>

<p class="author1"> <cite>Statutes of the Realm</cite>, vol. i. p. 262.</p>

   <p>"Item. Whereas before this time a horseman was wont to have his
   passage of the sea at the port of Dover for two shillings, and a
   man afoot for sixpence, and now of late have the guardians of
   passage and passagemen taken more, to the great damage of the
   people; so it is agreed that in the said port and all others, and
   also in all the other passages of the land, so well in fresh
   waters as in arms of the sea, the passengers shall pay henceforth
   as anciently they were wont, and more they shall not be charged,
   nor shall the passagemen nor guardians of the passages take any
   more."</p>

<p>The present steam-packet fares between Dover and Calais are, chief-cabin
eight shillings, fore-cabin six shillings, and horses twenty-five
shillings; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</i> for a man about <em>seven shillings</em>, and for a man and
horse about <em>thirty-two shillings</em>.</p>

<p>Hence it would appear, that the value of a shilling was sixteen times
greater, five hundred years since, than it is at present. A pound troy
of standard silver, from the Conquest to the 28th year of the reign of
Edward I., <span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 1300, was coined into twenty shillings; and from that
time to the 23rd of Edward III., <span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 1349, into twenty shillings and
three pence. The standard of silver coin was then 11 <i>oz.</i> 2 <i>dwts.</i>
pure silver, and 18 <i>dwts.</i> alloy, as it is at present; but a pound troy
of standard silver is now coined into sixty-six shillings. Therefore,
without taking into consideration the smaller fractions of a penny, the
shilling, from the Conquest to the middle of the reign of Edward III.,
contained the same quantity of silver as do three shillings and three
pence halfpenny of our present money. The sixpence paid by a passenger
at the date of the above quoted statute, contained a quantity of silver
equal to that contained in <em>one shilling and seven pence three
farthings</em>; and the two shillings paid for the passage of a man and
horse contained a quantity of silver equal to that contained in <em>six
shillings and seven pence</em> of our present coin of the realm.</p>

<p>Hence it appears that, whether it be for a man only, or for a man and
horse, we now pay, for a passage between Dover and Calais, nearly five
times as much silver as was paid for the same passage five or six
hundred years since. It would therefore seem, that the value of silver,
measured by this kind of labour, was then nearly five times greater than
its value in the present day.</p>

<p>I suspect however that silver was then really worth much more than five
times its present value; and in order to arrive at a more correct
conclusion, I shall be much obliged to any correspondent of "N. &amp; Q."
who will inform me what were the usual fares by sailing-vessels before,
or at the time of, the introduction of steam-packets between Dover and
Calais.</p>

<h3>
<span>POPULAR STORIES OF THE ENGLISH PEASANTRY, NO. II.<br />
(<i>Continued from</i> p. 363.)</span>
</h3>

<p>I am much pleased with M<span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span> S<span class="smcap lowercase">TERNBERG'S</span> Oxfordshire version of <cite>Die kluge
Else</cite> (Vol. v., p. 363.). I have heard another in that county, and think
the variations may be acceptable to those who are interested in our
rather scanty country legends.</p>

<p>An old couple lived in the country on a nice bit of land of their own,
and they had an only daughter whose name was Mary, and she had a
sweetheart whose name was John. Now there was a garden at the back of
their house with a well in it. One day, as the old man was walking in
the garden,<a id="Page_460"></a> <span class="pagenum">[460]</span> he thought a thought. He thought, "If John should
have Mary, and Mary should have a child, and the child was to go
tittle-tottle by the well, and to fall in, what a thing that would be;"
so he sat down and cried. A little while after the old woman came into
the garden and saw him, and asked him why he cried. And he told her he
had thought, "If John should have Mary, and Mary should have a child,
and the child should go tittle-tottle by the well, and fall in, what a
thing that would be." "So it would," said the old woman; and she sat
down and cried.</p>

<p>Mary arrives, hears the thought, and sits down and cries. John finds
them crying, and says he will put on a new pair of shoes, and if, by the
time they are worn out, he has not found three such big fools, he will
save the child's life by not marrying Mary. He puts on the shoes, and
sets out early the next morning.</p>

<p>Before he had gone far he came to a barn with the two doors wide open,
and saw a man hard at work with a shovel, as if he was a shovelling
something into the barn; but there was nothing in the shovel. "What be
ye doing of, Measter?" says John. "I be a shovelling the sunshine in to
dry the wheat as was carried in the wet." "What a fool ye be!" says
John; "why don't you take out the sheaves, and lay 'em in the sun?" "Oh,
God bless ye, Sir," says the man; "I wish ye'd come this way afore. Many
a hard day's work ye'd a saved me." So John cut a notch in his stick for
one fool, and went on.</p>

<p>He went a little further, and came to where a man was cutting at pebbles
with a knife. "What be ye at, Measter?" says John. "I be a cutting of
the pebbles to get at the kernels," says the man. "What a fool ye be!"
says John "why don't ye get a masonter's hammer and split 'em, and then
ye'll see whether there be any kernels or no." "Ah, God bless you, Sir,"
says the man "many a good knife ye'd a saved me if ye'd come this way
afore." So John made another notch for the second fool.</p>

<p>The third is drawing a cow up the ladder, to eat the tussock of grass
that grows every year in the thatch, and is equally thankful on being
advised to cut it down and give it to the cow; for "many a good cow ye'd
a saved me that I've throttled, if ye'd come this way afore." So John
cut the third notch; and finding that folly was not peculiar to the
family, went back and married Mary while his shoes were new. And they
lived very happy, and she put a rail round the well, and the child was
not drowned.</p>

<p>In this department of history, old women are the highest authorities,
and it is desirable to fix their localities as nearly as we can. I heard
the story from my nurse, a native of Souldern, Oxon., a village on the
borders of Northamptonshire, and from another of Bucknel, fourteen miles
north of Oxford.</p>

<p>A version of the <cite>Froschk√∂nig</cite> is, or was, current in the same
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>There was a farmer that had an only daughter; and she was very handsome,
but proud. One day, when the servants were all afield, her mother sent
her to the well for a pitcher of water. When she had let down the
bucket, it was so heavy that she could hardly draw it up again; and she
was going to let loose of it, when a voice in the well said, "Hold tight
and pull hard, and good luck will come of it at last." So she held tight
and pulled hard; and when the bucket came up there was nothing in it but
a frog, and the frog said, "Thank you, my dear; I've been a long while
in the well, and I'll make a lady of you for getting me out." So when
she saw it was only a frog, she took no notice, but filled her pitcher
and went home.</p>

<p>Now, when they were at supper, there came a knock at the door, and
somebody outside said,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p class="noindent">"Open the door, my dearest sweet one,</p>
        <p>And think of the well in the wood;</p>
      <p class="noindent">Where you and I were together, love a keeping,</p>
        <p>And think of the well in the wood."</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">So she looked out of the window, and there was the frog in boots and
spurs. So says she, "I sha'n't open the door for a frog." Then says her
father, "Open the door to the gentleman. Who knows what it may come to
at last?" So she opened the door, and the frog came in. Then says the
frog,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "Set me a chair, my dearest sweet one,</p>
     <p> And think," &amp;c.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">"I'm sure I sha'n't set a chair; the floor's good enough for a frog."
The frog makes many requests, to all of which the lady returns uncivil
answers. He asks for beer, and is told "Water is good enough for a
frog;" to be put to bed, but "The cistern is good enough for a frog to
sleep in." The father, however, insists on her compliance; and even when
the frog says, "Cuddle my back, my dearest sweet one," orders her to do
so, "For who knows what it may come to at last?" And in the morning,
when she woke, she saw by her side the handsomest gentleman that ever
was seen, in a scarlet coat and top-boots, with a sword by his side and
a gold chain round his neck, and gold rings on his fingers and he
married her and made her a lady, and they lived very happy together.</p>

<p>I suspect the <em>scarlet coat and top-boots</em> to be a modern interpolation,
the natural product of a sporting neighbourhood. It destroys the unity
of costume, as I believe Alderman Sawbridge is the only person recorded
as having gone hunting in a gold chain, and with a sword by his side.</p>

<p>Grimm's frog sings,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p> "K√∂nigstochter, j√ºngste, mach mir auf,</p>
      <p>Weisst du nicht wie gestern du zu mir gesagt</p>
      <p>Bei dem k√ºhlen Brunnenwasser?</p>
      <p> K√∂nigstochter, j√ºngste, mach mir auf."<a id="Page_461"></a> <span class="pagenum">[461]</span></p>

</div>

<p>There is not much difference in the song, but the moral tone of the
German is much higher. The frog restores the princess's golden ball,
which has fallen into the well, on her promising to do all those things
which he afterwards demands; and the king insists on her compliance,
because a promise is sacred, when made even to a frog. Our farmer
contradicts his daughter's inclinations to the verge, or perhaps beyond
the verge, of decorum, on the speculation of "what it may come to at
last." To be sure, if the Oxfordshire version is correct, she gets only
a sportsman for a husband.</p>

<h3>
<span>NO. III.</span>
</h3>

<p>There was once an old woman, who left her daughter at home to get dinner
ready, while she was at church. On coming back she found nothing
touched, and her daughter crying by the fire-place. "Why, what now?"
exclaimed the old woman. "Why, do you know," replied her daughter, "as I
was going to cook the dinner a brick fell down the chimney, and you know
it <em>might</em> have killed me." This the old woman could not deny, and
joined her daughter in her lamentations.</p>

<p>So in a little while the good man came in, and finding both weeping,
cried out, "What's the matter here? What, all in tears?" "Why," said the
old wife, "do you know, as Sally was going to get the dinner ready a
brick fell down the chimney, and you know it <em>might</em> have killed her."
This her husband was forced to confess, and lifted up his voice with
them.</p>

<p>Shortly after, Sally's sweetheart came in, and seeing the hubbub and
confusion, began, "What's up here? All weeping?" "Why, you know," said
the father, "as Sally was going to cook the dinner a brick fell down the
chimney, and you know it <em>might</em> have killed her." "Well!" said the
young man; "of all the fools I've seen, you three are the greatest; and
when I find three as great, why, then I'll come back and marry your
daughter."</p>

<p>So away he went and went till he came to where an old woman was busy,
for she was going to bake. But she bitterly bewailed her ill-luck; for,
instead of taking the bread to the oven, she had got a rope fastened to
the oven, and was trying with all her might to drag it to the bread, but
it wouldn't budge an inch for all her pains. "Oh, you fool," cried the
young man; "you should take the bread to the oven, and not try to drag
the oven to the bread." "Oh, I didn't think of that," said she; "la! so
I should." "Well, indeed, and that's fool number one," said the young
man; and he went on his way.</p>

<p>So he went and went, longer than I can tell, till he came to where an
old woman should feed her cow with grass that grew on her cottage-roof;
but, instead of throwing down the grass to the cow, she was trying to
drag the cow to the roof, but she could not, for all her pains. "Why,
you fool," said the young man, "cut the grass, and throw it to the cow,
to be sure." "Ay, I didn't think of that," said she. "That's fool number
two, sure enough; but it will be long before I meet such another."</p>

<p>But again he went and went, till at last he saw a man who was trying to
put his breeches on; but instead of holding them in his hand, he had
propped them up with sticks, and was trying in vain to take a running
jump into them. "Put in your legs, stupid!" said he. "That I didn't
think of," said the man. "Here, indeed, is fool number three," said the
young man. So he turned him homewards; came back to his sweetheart's
cottage, and married Sally, the old woman's daughter.</p>

<h3>
<span>GOLDSMITH'S HISTORY OF MECKLENBURGH.</span>
</h3>

<p>In Mr. Prior's <cite>Life of Goldsmith</cite> (vol. i. p. 388.), he observes that
"one of his (Goldsmith's) labours, if we may believe the accounts of
several personal acquaintances, for no certain evidence of the fact is
at hand, and the work has been sought for in vain," was <cite>The History of
Mecklenburgh</cite>, published for Newbery in February, 1762. This work, which
seems to have eluded Mr. Prior's great diligence, I have now before me.
It is in 8vo., to which a portrait of Queen Charlotte is prefixed, and
is entitled, <cite>The History of Mecklenburgh from the first Settlement of
the Vandals in that Country to the present Time, including a Period of
about Three Thousand Years</cite>: London, printed for J. Newbery, at the
Bible and Sun, in St. Paul's Churchyard, 1762. Pages, Preface, xiv.;
History, 360. It is dedicated by Newbery to the Queen, in a short and
rather elegant address, in which, as well as in the Preface which
follows, there are marks of Goldsmith's style. The History itself
appears to have been compiled in haste, and certainly bears no decisive
internal evidence of having Goldsmith for its author. It is, however,
rather superior to the ordinary run of similar compilations, and in some
parts&mdash;(see account of the Vandals, pp. 11. to 22., and character of
Gustavus Adolphus, p. 271.)&mdash;is not without proofs that the writer had
powers of pleasing and vigorous composition. It may have proceeded from
Goldsmith, and, as it is attributed to him by the accounts of several
personal acquaintances, in all probability did so; though, without some
indication of that kind, its authorship would not perhaps have been
suspected. Mr. Forster (<cite>Life of Goldsmith</cite>, p. 241.) states that for
the<a id="Page_462"></a> <span class="pagenum">[462]</span> revision of this work he (Goldsmith) received 20<i>l.</i>: but is
there any proof of this? Mr. Prior, as I understand him (see <cite>Life</cite>,
Vol. i. p. 416.), merely supposes that he might receive that sum, from
the prices paid for the other works of a similar kind.</p>

<h4>
<span>Eagles' Feathers.</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Will any of the correspondents of "N. &amp; Q." favour
me with an explanation of the allusion in the following passage?</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "You must cast away the workes of darknes, and then put on the
   armour of light: first you must put off, and then put on. <em>As the
   eagle's feathers will not lie with any other feathers, but
   consume them which lie with them</em>: so the wedding garment will
   not bee worne with filthie garments," &amp;c.</p>

<p>The passage is from a sermon on Rom. xiii. 14., entitled "The Wedding
Garment." It is contained in a volume in small 4to. (Lond. 1614), the
earlier portion of which contains six sermons by Maister <cite>Henry Smith</cite>;
and the latter, in which the above occurs, though it has no distinct

informed that a custom obtains in some parts of Ireland, of placing a
plate of snuff in the same situation; and that it is etiquette for all
those who are invited to the funeral to take a pinch on arriving at the
house of mourning. Hence has arisen the not very delicate threat, "I'll
get a pinch of snuff off your belly yet!" by which Paddy would intimate
to his rival his intention to survive him, and to crow over his remains.
This must, indeed, be a pinch of "<em>rale</em> Irish."</p>

<h3>
<span>ON A PASSAGE IN KING HENRY IV., PART I. ACT V. SC. 2.</span>
</h3>


<p>Pursuant to my conviction that most of the obscure passages in our great
poet's dramas arise from typographical errors in the early editions, I
submit the following suggested correction of an error in a noble
passage, which has hitherto passed unnoticed, to the candid
consideration of those who can enter into the spirit of the poet, and
are not pertinaciously wedded to the lapses of a very careless printer;
to whom, in my opinion, the editors of the first folio confided its
correction. Otherwise, we must presume they were unaccustomed to such
labour, and in the hurry of active life did their best, however
imperfectly.</p>

<p>I must be indulged with rather a long extract, that the reader may be
enabled at once to judge whether the words I impugn are in harmony with
the tone and spirit of Hotspur's speech.</p>

<div class="poem">

   <div class="stanza">

   <p class="noindent">  "<i>Enter a Messenger.</i></p>

      <p>If die, brave death, when princes die with us!</p>
      <p>Now for our consciences,&mdash;the arms are fair,</p>
      <p>When the intent of bearing them is just.</p>

   <div class="stanza">

   <div class="stanza">

      <p>For, heaven to earth, some of us never shall</p>
      <p> A second time do such a courtesy."</p>

    </div>

</div>

<p>What are we to understand by the words "For heaven to earth," in the
last line but one? Can they be tortured, by any ingenuity, to signify,
as Warburton paraphrases them, "One might wager heaven to earth"? To say
nothing, of such extraordinary and unwonted ellipsis, would it not be a
strange wager, and stranger thought, to enter Hotspur's mind at such a
moment? I feel assured that Shakspeare wrote, and that we should read:</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p> "Sound all the lofty instruments of war,</p>
      <p>And by that musick let us all embrace:</p>
      <p>For <em>here on</em> earth, some of us never shall</p>
      <p>A second time do such a courtesy."</p>

</div>


<p>If it should be thought that <em>here on</em> could not well be mistaken, even
in MS., for <em>heaven to</em>, I reply that stranger misreadings of the
compositor could be easily adduced; and that even in the preceding page
we have one at any rate more wide of the mark, where <em>supposition</em> is
printed in both the folios for <em>suspicion</em>.</p>

<p>How this extraordinary reading should have hitherto escaped suspicion, I
am at a loss to imagine, and feel assured that no one who is competent
to enter into the spirit of this exquisitely conceived passage, which
breathes the true expression of heroic pathos, will attempt a
vindication of the old reading.</p>

<p>&mdash;The unknown author of <cite>Thirty days hath

<h4>
<span>The Dodo, existing Specimen of.</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;A friend of mine has just informed
me, on the authority of one of the principal members of the family, that
at Nettlecombe Park, in Somersetshire, the seat of Sir John Trevelyan,
Bt., there is now existing a stuffed specimen, entire, of the supposed
extinct bird, the Dodo.</p>

<p>How is it that such an important fact should have escaped the notice of
the principal naturalists of the country? At the Great Exhibition there
was a manufactured specimen of this bird, which called forth, I believe,
the encomium of Mr. Strickland and other well-known naturalists; but not
a word was said about this alleged real specimen at Nettlecombe Park.
There was in the same case which contained this fictitious Dodo, a cast
of the head and leg from the remains now in the Ashmolean Museum at
Oxford,&mdash;the only portions, I believe, that were rescued when the entire
specimen of the bird, once in that collection, was destroyed. It is
said, I think, there are other remains somewhere abroad; but that there
is no <em>entire</em> specimen of the Dodo now in existence anywhere, is, I
imagine, the universal belief. I hope that you, or some of your
correspondents, may be able to solve this mystery, or set my friends
right should they be labouring under some mistake.</p>

<p>There was a widow (Anne) and her daughter-in-law (Jane), and a man
(George) and his son (Henry). The widow married the son, and the
daughter married the father. The widow was therefore mother (in-law) to
her husband's father, and consequently grandmother to her own husband
(Henry). By this husband she had a son (David), to whom she was
great-grandmother. Now, as the son of a great-grandmother must be either
a grandfather or great uncle, this boy (David) was one or the other. He
was his own grandfather! This was the case with a boy at school at
Norwich.</p>

<span class="bla">Queries.</span>
</h2>

<h3>
<span>WHERE WAS ANNE BOLEYN BURIED?</span>
</h3>

<p>It is said in Miss Strickland's <cite>Queens of England</cite> (iv. 203.), that
there is a tradition at Salle in Norfolk that the remains of Anne Boleyn
were removed from the Tower, and interred at midnight, with the rites of
Christian burial, in Salle Church, and that a plain black stone without
any inscription is supposed to indicate the place where she was buried.
An account of Salle Church, with the inscriptions on the Boleyn
monuments, is given in the 4th volume of Blomefield's <cite>Norfolk</cite> (folio
ed.), p. 421., but no allusion is made to any such tradition; and other
parts of the same work, where the Boleyns (including the Queen) are
referred to, are equally silent on the subject. Lord Herbert of
Cherbury, in his <cite>History of King Henry VIII.</cite>, does not state how or
where she was buried. Hollingshed, Stow, and Speed say, that her body,
with the head, was buried in the choir of the chapel in the Tower; and
Sandford, that she was buried in the chapel of St. Peter in the Tower.</p>

<p>Burnet (vol. i. p. 318.), who is followed by Henry, Hume, and Lingard,
says that her body was thrown into a common chest of elm-tree that was
made to put arrows in, and was buried in the chapel within the Tower,
before twelve o'clock. Sharon Turner, in his <cite>History of the Reign of
King Henry VIII.</cite>, vol. ii p. 464., cites the following passage from
Crispin's account of Anne Boleyn's execution, written fourteen days
after her death, viz.:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "Her ladies immediately took up her head and the body. They
   seemed to be without souls, they were so languid and extremely
   weak; but fearing that their mistress might be handled unworthily
   by inhuman men, they forced themselves to do this duty; and
   though almost dead, at last carried off her dead body wrapt in a
   white covering."<a id="Page_465"></a> <span class="pagenum">[465]</span></p>

<p>In a letter in the <cite>Gentleman's Magazine</cite> for October, 1815, signed "J.
C.," it is said&mdash;</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "But the headless remains of the departed Queen were said to be
   deposited in an arrow-chest, and buried in the Tower Chapel,
   before the High Altar. Where that stood, the most sagacious
   antiquary, after a lapse of less than three hundred years, cannot
   now determine; nor is the circumstance, though related by eminent
   writers, clearly ascertained. In a cellar the body of a person of
   short stature, without a head, not many years since was found,
   and supposed to be the reliques of poor Anna; but soon after
   re-interred in the same place, and covered with earth."</p>

<p>I am informed that the stone in Salle Church was some time since raised,
but that no remains were to be found underneath it. Has the tradition
referred to by Miss Strickland been noticed by any other writer? and
upon what authority does Burnet say that her remains were placed in an
arrow-chest? I may add that Miss S. states that a similar tradition is
assigned to a black stone in the church at Thornden on the Hill: but
Morant, in his <cite>History of Essex</cite>, does not notice it.</p>

<h3>
<span>TORTOISESHELL TOM CATS.</span>
</h3>

<p>Can any correspondents of "N. &amp; Q." who may have paid particular
attention to natural history, throw any light or grounds for explaining
the fact of there, I may almost say, never being instances of a <em>male
tortoiseshell cat</em>? for though I have been very lately told that such a
one was exhibited in the great display in Hyde Park, yet as I did not
witness it myself, I can only use it as the exception which proves the
general rule.</p>

<p>Having for the last fifty years been in the constant habit of keeping
cats, and having frequently during that time possessed many of a rare
and foreign breed, some of which were tortoise-shells of the most
beautiful varieties, I have always endeavoured, by mixing the breeds in
every way, to procure a male of this peculiar colour; but with the vast
number of kittens that during this long period have fallen under my
observation, I have invariably found that if there was the slightest
appearance of a single <em>black hair</em> on one, otherwise <em>white and
orange</em>, so sure would it prove a female; and thus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice vers√¢</i>, an
orange hair appearing on a black and white skin, even in the smallest
degree, would immediately proclaim the sex.</p>

<p>I have asked for an elucidation of this curious fact from two of our
greatest naturalists of the present day, but without any success; I have
racked my own brain even for some plausible mode of accounting for it,
but in vain; for it should be observed that this peculiarity or line of
demarcation as to sexes does not obtain with other animals, for I have
seen what may be called tortoiseshell horses and cows, that is, with the
same admixture of colours, and yet they have been indiscriminately of
both sexes.</p>

<p>Now it is true we hear occasionally of a <em>tortoiseshell tom cat</em>
advertised as having been seen or heard of, but in all these instances a
solution of the <em>nitrate of silver</em> has been <em>freely used to aid the
imposition</em>, and with all the pains I have taken, I have never been
fortunate enough to meet with a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bon√¢ fide</i> ocular demonstration.</p>

<p>Should any of the correspondents of "N. &amp; Q." have it in their power to
throw light on this curious fact in natural history, it will much
gratify me, even if it should prove that I am making much about nothing.</p>

<span class="bla">Minor Queries.</span>
</h3>

<h4>
<span>Oasis.</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;What is the proper pronunciation of this word? Ninety-nine
people out of a hundred will say, as <em>I</em> said, "O&#257;sis, of course!"
Let them, however, proceed to consult authorities, and they will begin
to be puzzled. Its derivation from the Coptic "w√°he" (or "ouahe," the
French way of expressing the Egyptian word w√°he.&mdash;<cite>Encycl. Metrop.</cite>)
seems universally admitted. As to the pronunciation, the way in which
the word is accented by the different authorities in which I have been
able to find it is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc" title="[Greek: Oasis (polis).]">&#8012;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#962; (&#960;&#8057;&#955;&#953;&#962;).</span>&mdash;<cite>Herodot.</cite> iii. 26. Larcher's <cite>Notes</cite>, and
Liddell and Scott's <cite>Greek Lexicon</cite>, give no help as to the
pronunciation.</p>

<p>Rees's <cite>Cyclop√¶dia</cite>, and the <cite>Encyclop√¶dia Britannica</cite>, do not accent
the word at all. Brasse's <cite>Greek Gradus</cite>, Ainsworth's and Riddle's
<cite>Dictionaries</cite>, Yonge's <cite>Gradus</cite>, Walker's <cite>Rhyming Dictionary</cite>,
Webster, Richardson, and Johnson, do not even contain the word.</p>

<p>The few authorities which <em>do</em> accent the word, do it "with a
difference." Ex. gr.:</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>O'asis.&mdash;<cite>Penny Cyclop√¶dia.</cite></p>
      <p>O'asis.&mdash;<cite>Imperial Dictionary.</cite></p>

      <p>O&#257;sis.&mdash;Butler's <cite>Classical Atlas</cite>. Index.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Who is right? I have searched all the Indices to the Delphin edition of
the Latin poets, without finding the word at all. A Cambridge friend
quoted at once "sacramque Ammonis oasim;" but, on being pressed,
admitted, that if it were not the fag-end of some prize-poem line
lurking in his memory, he did not know whence it came. I cannot get
anybody to produce me an instance of the use of the word in English
poetry. One says, "I am sure it's in Moore," and another, "You're sure
to find it in Milton;" but our English poets lack verbal indices. Some
such line as "Some green oasis in the desert's waste," haunts my own
memory, but I cannot give it a "local habitation." Of course, two or
three instances from <em>English</em> poets would not <em>absolutely</em> determine
the question one way or the other, as we pronounce many words derived
from Greek and Latin sources in defiance of their original quantity.
Still they would not be without their value. Can any wise man of the
East help?<a id="Page_466"></a> <span class="pagenum">[466]</span></p>

<h4>
<span>Dr. Toby Matthew.</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In Le Neve's <cite>Lives of the Protestant Archbishops</cite>
under Dr. Toby Matthew, Archbishop of York, it is stated that he was
appointed Bishop of Durham in 1595; and that on 7th April, Archbishop
Whitgift granted a commission to Archbishop Hutton, "to confirm and
consecrate this our bishop within the province of Canterbury, which,"
says Le Neve, "no doubt was done accordingly, though I cannot find,
either in his diary or elsewhere, the time when, place where, or the
names of the bishops who assisted at that solemnity," (vol. ii. pp.
105-6.). In Surtees' <cite>History of Durham</cite>, it is said that his
consecration took place on "Palm Sunday." Palm Sunday fell on 9th April
that year: the very Sunday, therefore, which followed the date of the
licence mentioned by Le Neve. I believe Surtees refers to <cite>Rot. Durham</cite>
as his authority. In the <cite>Church of England Magazine</cite>, Jan. 1847, p.
13., there is a Life of Dr. T. Matthew, said to be "Abridged from a
manuscript in the British Museum, entitled 'The Preaching Bishop,'" &amp;c.
Does this document supply the information which Le Neve sought in
vain?<a id="vain3"></a><a title="Go to footnote 3." href="#fn3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Can any reader ascertain from the diary, or elsewhere, what the
bishop was doing on 9th April, 1595, or where he was; or give any
information on the subject?</p>


     <p class="right"> C. H. D.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn3"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#vain3" class="label">[3]</a> [The MS. in the British Museum does not supply
      the information required; it merely corrects Bishop
      Godwyn's date of the consecration, viz. March, 1594:
      "but," says the writer, "he was mistaken; it was the
      year after, for he preached the first sermon after he was
      made bishop, May 11, 1595, as he himself sets down,
      being then forty-eight years of age." It is not given
      in Mr. Perceval's valuable list of the consecrations of
      English prelates in the Appendix to his <cite>Apology for the
      Apostolical Succession</cite>, so that we may conclude it is not
      to be found among the Lambeth records. It is possible
      it may be found in the document quoted by Surtees,
      viz. "Rot. Mathew, A."&mdash;E<span class="smcap lowercase">D</span>.]</p>

<h4>
<span>Burial without Religious Service.</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In case of the friends of any
person deceased either objecting to, or not wishing to compel the
clergyman to use, the burial service, is there any law to <em>forbid</em> the
corpse being interred in the parish churchyard <em>without any religious
service at all</em>? Suppose the deceased were a baptized dissenter, who had
himself in his lifetime objected to, and whose surviving relatives also
objected to the performance of the burial service, though they wished
the body to be deposited in the churchyard; does a clergyman render
himself liable to any penalty in <em>permitting</em> the body to be thus
silently interred? Some years ago, at the Kensal Green cemetery the sons
of Carlile <em>protested at the grave</em> against the performance of <em>any</em>
religious service. The chaplain persisted in its performance in spite of
their expressed wishes to the contrary! Was this right or wrong in a
legal point of view?</p>

<h4>
<span>Ganganelli's Bible.</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Can any of your readers inform me who was the
translator of the "Ganganelli (Pope) Bible," published in 1784 in folio,
what is the merit of the translation, and who wrote the notes? If I
mistake not, Evans, the auctioneer who sold the Duke of Sussex's
library, puts in the catalogue that the notes are not the Pope's, it
being "a scandalous imposture" in the title-page to say so, "for they
have a free-thinking tendency."</p>

<p>The title-page of said Bible says that that Pope and the translator were
liberals, and the author of the notes must have been a radical, all very
intelligible in those days, but not without instruction to these.</p>

<h4>
<span>Derivation of the Word "Callis," an Almshouse.</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The word is not given
in Bailey or Richardson. It appears in Holloway's and Halliwell's
<cite>Provincial Dictionaries</cite> <a id="Page_467"></a> <span class="pagenum">[467]</span> in the plural, and is spelt
"calasses." Each quotes Grose, who refers the word to the <cite>Gentleman's
Magazine</cite> for May, 1784; but there the above question only is asked, and
is unanswered. It has been suggested that the callis may be so called
from its having been founded by some merchant of the Staple of Calais,
or from its endowment being derived from donations to the chalice, made
by persons to the priest administering extreme unction. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Calis</i> was the
old form of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chalice</i>.&mdash;Vide Halliwell's <i>Dictionary</i>.</p>

possess a (not quite perfect) copy? Speaking of Iceland, he says,&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "It is reported, that the Pope long since gaue them a

     <p class="right"> C. M<span class="smcap lowercase">ANSFIELD</span> I<span class="smcap lowercase">NGLEBY</span>.</p>

   <p class="blockquot">[1. The first quotation will be found in a letter of Archbishop
   Tillotson's to Bishop Burnet, dated Oct. 23, 1694. The archbishop
   says, "The account given of Athanasius' Creed (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</i> in Burnet's
   <cite>Exposition of the Thirty-nine Articles</cite>) seems to me no-wise
   satisfactory. I wish we were well rid of it." Dr. Birch adds,
   "The archbishop did not long survive the writing of this
   letter."&mdash;See Birch's <cite>Life of Tillotson</cite>, edit. 1752, p. 343.;

   <p class="blockquot">2. The second quotation is probably the following, which occurs
   in Dr. South's Sermon on the Nature and Measures of Conscience
   (Serm. XXIII.): "Because the light of natural conscience is in
   many things defective and dim, and the internal voice of God's
   Spirit not always distinguishable, above all, let a man attend to
   the mind of God, uttered in His <em>revealed Word</em>: I say, His
   revealed Word; by which I do not mean that mysterious,
   extraordinary (and of late so much studied) book called 'The
   Revelation,' and which, perhaps, the more it is studied, the less
   it is understood, as generally either finding a man cracked, or
   making him so; but I mean those other writings of the prophets
   and apostles, which exhibit to us a plain, sure, perfect, and
   intelligible rule; a rule that will neither fail nor distract
   such as make use of it."]</p>

<h3>
<span>ANCIENT TIMBER TOWN-HALLS.<br />
(Vol. v., pp. 257. 295.)</span>
</h3>

<p>M<span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span> P<span class="smcap lowercase">ARKER</span> makes some inquiries relative to the ancient town-halls of
our country towns; and should the following particulars of some still in
existence be of service, I shall feel a pleasure in having been the
means of gratifying his curiosity.</p>

<p>The town-hall in the city of Hereford is a timber structure built upon
twenty-seven pillars, and was originally a very handsome building, but
was many years since denuded of its upper story, in which the fourteen
different trading companies of the city transacted their business. It
was erected by the celebrated John Abel, in the reign of James I. Prior
to the erection of the present county hall, the assizes were held in
this building.</p>

<p>The town-hall at Leominster, or Butter-cross as it is frequently called
by the inhabitants, was erected in the year 1633, by the above-named
architect; it stands upon twelve oak pillars, and was originally
ornamented with a variety of curious carvings, and the shields of arms
of those who contributed towards the expense of its erection, but which
have long since vanished. Around the building, just above the pillars,
was inscribed the following sentences, but portions of which only now
remain. On the south side:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "Vive Deo gratus, toti mundo tumulatus, crimine mundatus, semper
   transire paratus."</p>

<p>On the east side:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "Where justice reigns, there virtue flows. Sat cito, si sat bene
   vive ut post vivas. As columns do support the fabric of a
   building, so noble gentry do subprop the honour of a state."</p>

<p>On the north side:</p>

     <p class="blockquot"> "In memori√¢ √¶tern√¢ erit Justus, 1663."</p>

<p>In the year 1793, this hall underwent very considerable repairs, more
properly called spoliation, by taking down the gables, and with them the
curious carvings, shields of arms, &amp;c., which must have greatly
destroyed its picturesque effect. It contains a clock, and is surmounted
by a cupola, in which is a bell, whereon the hours strike.</p>

<p>The town-halls of Brecon, Kington,<a id="ton4"></a><a title="Go to footnote 4." href="#fn4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and Weobly, and probably others of
which at present I can give no particulars, were built by the same
person. Mr. Abel being in Hereford when that city was besieged in 1645,
was of great service by constructing mills to grind corn for the use of
the inhabitants and soldiers confined therein, for which Charles I.
afterwards conferred upon him the title of one of his majesty's
carpenters.</p>


<p class="footnote"><a id="fn4"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#ton4" class="label">[4]</a> This hall had similar inscriptions to those of
      Leominster.</p>


<p>In Sarnesfield churchyard, in the county of Hereford, is a monument
consisting of the effigies of himself and his two wives, with the
emblems of his profession, executed by his own hands after he reached
the patriarchal age of ninety years; it has the following inscription,
being his own composition:</p>

     <div class="poem">

      <p>"This craggy stone a covering is for an architector's bed,</p>
      <p> That lofty buildings raised high, yet now lyes low his head:</p>
      <p>His line and rule, so death concludes, are locked up in store,</p>
      <p>Build they who list, or they who wist, for he can build no more.</p>

<p>In my reply to a Query upon the interesting subject introduced by
 M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. J. H. P<span class="smcap lowercase">ARKER</span>, I felt anxious to direct his attention to other peculiar
characters appertaining to the ancient town of Wokingham, besides those
marks by which it in some degree approximates to his general description
of the English towns in France. In reply to M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. P<span class="smcap lowercase">ARKER'S</span> inquiry
respecting the medi√¶val town-halls, and other public halls of that
period remaining in England (Vol. v., p. 295.), I have much pleasure in
forwarding the following account of the Town-hall of Leicester, which
formerly belonged to the Guild of Corpus Christi, in the church of St.
Martin. It was built in the reign of Elizabeth, and was first opened by
a banquet, given by George Norris, the mayor, to celebrate the victory
over the Spanish Armada. This anniversary was continued until within the
memory of some of the burgesses now living, and was called the "Venison
Feast." The hall is a low-roofed timber building, lighted by plain
latticed windows, and was enlarged, by the addition of the <em>Mayor's
parlour</em>, in 1636. The great hall, or court, is fitted with appropriate
seats of state for the mayor and aldermen, and with galleries for
spectators of municipal ceremonies; and its walls were formerly enriched
with many valuable paintings. The adjoining parlour is remarkable for
the quaint character of its decorations; it is, like the great hall,
provided with state seats or benches, and has a long range of low
windows, containing stained glass illustrative of religious subjects,
and emblems of the seasons. The Town-library is a storied building,
containing a large hall, founded by the Corporation in 1632, and
possessing at present about 1000 volumes, chiefly of old divinity,
together with a few miscellaneous books, and a MS. of the Greek
Testament written<a id="Page_471"></a> <span class="pagenum">[471]</span> on vellum and paper, supposed to be of the
thirteenth century, and which was given to the library in 1649 by the
Rector of Thrussington.</p>

<p>There are hospitals in Leicester of similar style, and two of much
earlier periods, 1330 and 1512.</p>

<h3>
<span>OLD TREES.&mdash;FAIRLOP OAK.<br />
(Vol. v., p. 114.)</span>
</h3>

<p>I have, in my scrap-book, a curious old print of Fairlop Oak, to which
some verses are attached, which I think is somewhat of a rarity. It is
on thin, miserable paper; size, demy quarto; without date or printer's
name; in general character bearing a very Catnachian aspect. The print
of the tree occupies nearly half the sheet, and is a most vile specimen
of both drawing and engraving. The tree is represented as in a
dilapidated condition, with a huge hollow trunk, within which are seen
some persons making themselves "jolly" at a drinking-table. The tree has
but five principal branches, and these are only tipped here and there
with foliage, the work of popular demolition under which the tree is
known to have fallen being plainly seen in its many barren branches, and
still more pointedly suggested by the four persons, who, having climbed
aloft, are airing themselves in the forks of its boughs. The background
is filled up with the incidents of the fair. To the right, in the
fore-ground, is one of the well-known "boats" mounted on wheels, the
deck manned by blockmakers "on their legs" singing a chorus. Behind, in
the distance, is a theatre or exhibition-booth, with the band and sundry
performers entertaining the crowd gratis; on the proscenium above is
written, ... G<span class="smcap lowercase">ELL</span>. C<span class="smcap lowercase">LARK</span>. On the left hand is another of these
unclassical erections, with a man in front balancing himself on a
ladder; the name S<span class="smcap lowercase">AUNDERS</span> being inscribed above. Below this is an
exhibition of a minor sort, and several groups of gaping cockneys. A
"boat," a booth, and a set of "knock 'em down" complete the scene; in
the latter case a woman caters for the encouragement of the English but
ignoble sport of "three throws a penny."<a id="penny5"></a><a title="Go to footnote 5." href="#fn5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Below the print is a line in
large type (scarcely legible), announcing it to be "An original Drawing
by an eminent Artist [printed off] a Woodcut engraved on a Block of the
celebrated Tree." I transcribe literally what follows.<a id="Page_472"></a> <span class="pagenum">[472]</span></p>

   (?)], measured, at 3 feet from the ground, about 36 feet in
   girth, and the boughs extended about 300 feet in circumference.
   The Fair which was held upon this spot was founded about the year
   1720, by Mr. Daniel Day, Block Maker, of Wapping, who gave his
   men an annual Bean Feast, under the shade of the Oak, on the
   first Friday in July; and which has been visited for a number of
   years by the Block Makers and Watermen of the eastern part of the

<p class="blockquot">"A few years before Mr. Day died, his favourite oak lost a limb,
   out of which he procured a coffin to be made for his own
   interment, and often used to lie down in it, to try how it would
   fit him. He died October 13, 1767, aged eighty-four, and his
   remains were conveyed to Barking by water, pursuant of his own
   request, accompanied by six journeymen Block and Pump Makers, to
   each of whom he bequeathed a new leathern apron and a guinea."</p>


<p>So runs this historical and poetical (?) fragment. The first song I have
often heard sung, or rather bawled, by Mr. Hemingway from one of the
windows in the street which diverges out of the Mil-End Road, at the
"King's Arms." That was before I commenced my teens. Hemingway has long
since gone the way of Daniel Day; and Fairlop has lost so much of its
original vigour and popularity, as to be almost one of the things that
were.</p>

<p>There is an engraving of Fairlop Oak, as it appeared in 1806, in the
<cite>Gentleman's Magazine</cite> for July, 1806, p. 617. I think that some
particulars of Fairlop Oak are given in Loudon's <cite>Arboretum</cite>. The
woodcut in the <cite>Mirror</cite> referred to (p. 114.)<a id="Page_473"></a> <span class="pagenum">[473]</span> bears some
resemblance, in the outline of the tree, to my specimen of the Catnach

<h3>
<span>TAYLOR FAMILY.<br />
(Vol. v., p. 370.)</span>
</h3>


<p>The first person of the name as Mayor of Worcester, occurring in 1648,
is James Taylor, Esq.; in 1666, Henry Taylor, Esq.; in 1675, Rowland
Taylor, Esq.; in 1731, Samuel Taylor, Esq. In 1732, James Saunders,
Esq., was elected, but, dying in his mayoralty, Samuel Taylor, Esq., was
re-elected, to serve the remainder of the year; and in 1737, a Samuel
Taylor, Esq., was again elected, and this is no doubt the same person,
making his third election.</p>

<p>It is, I think, evident from the following, which may be found in
Green's History of that city, vol. ii. p. 106. of Appendix, that their
burial-place was in a vault at the west end of the north aisle of St.
Helen's Church:&mdash;</p>


<p class="blockquot">   "Opposite the pulpit&mdash;Richard Taylor, Alderman of this city, died
   Nov. 11th, 1754, aged sixty-eight. There are several more of the
   same family interred under this stone."</p>


<p>In 1718, a Mr. Thomas Taylor, lay clerk, and in 1719, Elizabeth, wife of
Mr. Thomas Taylor, a lay clerk of this church (Worcester Cathedral),
were buried therein.</p>

<p>I think it very probable, from the orthography of the names being alike,
that the above parties were connected by family ties.</p>

<p>I do not find, either in my own MS., in Green's History, or any other
work, memorials of the same name in any other of the Worcester churches.</p>

<p>Nash, in his County History, gives the arms of Taylor of Welland, a
small village near Upton-on-Severn: "sable, a lion passant, argent."</p>

<p>On flat stones within the communion-rails of that (Welland) church are
the following inscriptions:&mdash;</p>


<p class="blockquot"> "Edmund Taylor, Esq., died 10 Jan., 1721, aged 55.</p>

<p class="blockquot">  "'Hic jacet Radulphus Taylor vir nullo non doctrin√¶ genere
   instructissimus uxorem duxit Penelopen filiam natu secundam
   Nicholai Lechmere de Hanleycastle, armigeri, quarto die Junii,
   obiit, <span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 1676, √¶t. 39;' and several of their children are here
   buried.</p>

<p class="blockquot">  "Penelope Taylor, died 29 May, 1710, aged 62."</p>

<p>Arms on the stone.</p>

<p>I know of no family of the name resident in that city; but, having left
it many years, I am almost a stranger to its inhabitants. But I
recollect a gentleman of that name resident at Strensham, the
birth-place of the poet Butler (<cite>Hudibras</cite>), and who, to his honour, in
1843, erected a monument to the memory of that celebrated man, in the
church of his native village. His name was John Taylor, Esq.</p>

<span>The Meaning of "to be a Deacon"</span>
<span> (Vol. v., p. 228.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;An allusion to
the fact, that to become a deacon (the first step in the priesthood) it
was necessary to have <em>the hair cut</em>, which is also done previous to
beheading. In Foxe's time the customs of the Roman church were known to
all.</p>

<p>&mdash;Perhaps the following brief particulars of this
celebrated physician may be acceptable to your correspondent M. A.
L<span class="smcap lowercase">OWER</span>, Vol. v., p. 227. He was born in the county of Suffolk, educated
at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he became Chaplain of New College.
He<a id="Page_474"></a> <span class="pagenum">[474]</span> was for some time chaplain, and probably tutor, to the Foley
family in Worcestershire; but after the Restoration took his degrees in
medicine, and became an eminent practitioner in London, dying at his
residence in Surrey in the year 1698. An engraved portrait of him, with
the large flowing wig of the period, now lies before me, with this
inscription:</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "Richardus Morton, M.D.</p>
      <p>Colleg: Med: Lond: Soc."</p>

the Mortons of Severn Stoke, co. Worcester.</p>

<h4>
<span>Moravian Hymns</span>
<span>(Vol. iv., pp. 30. 502.; Vol. v., pp. 113. 129.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Your
correspondents having met with the third part only, I will describe the
first and second parts now before me. Both were printed for James
Hutton, London, 1746, who printed also <cite>The Watchwords of the Covenant
in the Blood of Jesus for the Years 1743 and 1746</cite>. They contain 403
hymns, and two supplements. I have sought in vain for the hymn in the
<cite>New Bath Guide</cite>, but the two following will show that Anstey did not
colour too highly.</p>

<p>Many circumstances concurred to render these books now very rare. The
impression was undoubtedly limited, and the wear and tear of
enthusiastic singers for above a century, of a 12mo. book of nearly a
thousand pages, very great. Unless preserved in "N. &amp; Q.," the existence
of such hymns might be doubted some years hence, even by the religious
fraternity for whom they were compiled, and whose collection is now
widely different:</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "Jesu! our joy, and loving friend,</p>
      <p>Both thy dear wings around extend,</p>
          <p>Thy little chickens hide.</p>
      <p>Would Satan seize us as his prey,</p>
      <p>Then let the angels sing and say,</p>
          <p>This chick shall undisturb'd abide."</p>

<h4>
<span>Junius Rumours</span>
<span> (Vol. v., pp. 125. 159.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In spite of the memorable
declaration of Junius that his secret should perish with him, and the
hitherto unsatisfactory attempts that have been made to draw him from
his hiding-place, I have ever felt assured that he will eventually be
unearthed. After half a century's active exertion, the "Iron Mask" was
unveiled.</p>

<p>I recollect that, somewhere in Woodfall's edition, is a letter from
Junius, requiring a copy of the letters to be sent him, bound in a
particular manner and colour, which, at the time that edition came out,
was thought likely to afford a clue to the detection: some such casual
notice may not yet be unlikely to lead to the discovery. Many years
since, in conversation with an old officer, then barrack-master at
Pendennis Garrison, Captain Hall, he related a circumstance that
occurred when he was a boy, that curiously impressed itself on his
memory. His family and Woodfall's were intimate, and when about ten
years old he was taken by his mother to see Woodfall, whilst in prison
on account of the publication of these redoubtable letters.</p>

<p>During this visit a tea-service of plate was received by Woodfall as a
present from Junius, and was exhibited with no small degree of pride and
gratification. Surely two such circumstances could not occur without
being known to more than one or two persons; and had the inquiry been
keenly followed up, I think, not unreasonably, that a chance might be
afforded for the solution of the problem.</p>

<h4>
<span>Wyned</span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 321.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The supposition that the initial <em>w</em> of
this word may have been a misreading for <em>pa</em>, however ingenious, is not
tenable. Not having the MS. at hand (it is in the University Library,
Cambridge), I wrote to a learned friend there to request him to refer to
the passage. He assures me that the word is <i lang="und" xml:lang="und">wyned</i>, not <em>payned</em>.
Indeed, the precedent being fairly written in a clerkly hand, there was
little possibility of mistake. I beg, therefore, to leave the word in
the hands of your etymological reader for further suggestion or
explanation.</p>

<h4>
<span>The Tradescants</span>
<span>(Vol. iii., pp. 119. 286. 391. 393. 469.; Vol. v., pp.
266. 367. 385.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The ensuing Note, although it has no reference to
<em>the</em> Tradescants who have been the subject of many interesting
communications in "N. &amp; Q.," will, perhaps, not be considered
unacceptable; for, in conjunction with the mention made in the will of
the younger John Tradescant (p. 367.) of his "two namesakes, Robert
Tradescant and Thomas Tradescant of Walberswick in the Countie of
Suffolk," to whom the testator, if his love is to be estimated by the
amount of their legacies, would not appear to have borne much
esteem,&mdash;it establishes the fact that there was, at that time, at least
one collateral branch of the Tradescant family. I find in the town books
of Harleston, in Norfolk, the name of a <em>John Tredeskin</em> as a resident
in that town in the year 1682-83, and of <em>Mr. Robert Tredeskin</em> from
1683-84 to 1688-89 inclusive, and from that time to 1691-92 <em>Mrs.
Tradeskin</em>, widow, appears as the occupier, in the last year the name
being spelt <em>Tradescant</em>. The name also occurs in the Court Books of the
Manor of Harleston. Robert Tradescant, and Martha his wife, are
mentioned in 1687, and it appears that<a id="Page_475"></a> <span class="pagenum">[475]</span> she survived and was
afterwards the wife of Charles Fox, gentleman. In 1721 John Tradescant
is described as son and heir of the said Robert and Martha, both
deceased. I have not met with it at a later period. Whether this
Harleston family branched from Walberswick, or whether either were
actually related to the Lambeth Tradescants,&mdash;for the term "namesake"
does not of itself imply relationship&mdash;is not certain, but both are at
all events probable. I may observe that the prefix <em>Mr.</em> indicated a
person above the rank of a tradesman, and such as we should now address
upon a letter as "Esquire."</p>

<h4>
<span>Movable Organs and Pulpits</span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 345.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Of the first-named
class of curious ecclesiastical structures I know of no examples; of one
of the latter, the following notice occurs in Mr. Wesley's <cite>Journal</cite>,
vol. iv. p. 213.:&mdash;</p>

  <p> "<i>Aug. 15 (1781).</i> I went to Sheffield: in the afternoon I took a
   view of the chapel lately built by the Duke of Norfolk. One may
   safely say, there is none like it in the three kingdoms, nor, I
   suppose, in the world. It is a stone building, an octagon, about
   eighty feet in diameter.... The pulpit is movable: it rolls upon
   wheels; and is shifted once a quarter, that all the pews may face
   it in their turns: I presume the first contrivance of the kind in
   Europe."</p>

<p class="noindent">This was an episcopal place of worship connected with a noble charity,
"The Shrewsbury Hospital," a suite of liberally-endowed almshouses for
old people of both sexes. The "chapel" in question, as well as the
almshouses, have, many years ago, given place to a large market. But I
must add, the charity still flourishes, and its recipients enjoy a suite
of beautiful little dwellings, and a commodious place of worship, in a
pleasant and airy part of "Sheffield Park."</p>

<h4>
<span>Scologlandis and Scologi</span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 416.).</span>
</h4>



<p>&mdash;These words are derived
from <i lang="cel" xml:lang="cel">sgol√≥g</i>, a Celtic word meaning a farmer, a husbandman, and
probably denote the husbandlands and husbandmen holding the kirktoun
(church lands) of Ellon, or parts thereof. A distinction is drawn
between the husbandman and the cotter in an unpublished return to an
inquisition in 1450, concerning the payments and services due by certain
tenants of some ecclesiastical lands&mdash;"that is to say, of ylke husband
an thraf (threave) of corn and half an ferlot of meil, and of ylke coter
an pek." The husbands of church lands (bondi of Scotch charter Latin?)
were in all likelihood the "Kyndlie tenantis" of the church, who seem to
have had a sort of hereditary right to renewal of their leases on
payment of a fine, either taxed or uncertain. In a charter lately before
me, a lease of tithes was renewed to the holder as "Kyndlie tenant," on
payment of a grassum (equivalent to a fine), and it was declared that
the said tenant and his ancestors had held the vicarage land
hereditarily, past the memory of man, on payment of a rent, though the
said vicarage land belonged in property to the vicar. Neither <i lang="cel" xml:lang="cel">sgol√≥g</i>
nor <i lang="und" xml:lang="und">bondi</i> are applicable to tenants of church lands exclusively. The
compilers of the Highland Society's <cite>Gaelic Dictionary</cite> do not appear to
have met with the word <i lang="cel" xml:lang="cel">sgol√≥g</i>, or, if they did, have confounded it
with <i lang="cel" xml:lang="cel">scal√≥g</i> or <i lang="cel" xml:lang="cel">sgal√≥g</i>, a boor, a hind, a countryman.</p>

<h4>
<span>St. Botolph</span>
<span> (Vol. v., p. 396.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Your correspondent A. B. has
anticipated an inquiry I was about to make as to the history of this
saint, which I am desirous of learning. It is a rather singular
circumstance that three churches dedicated to St. Botolph, and all of
ancient foundation, are situated immediately without gates of the city,
viz. at Aldgate, Bishopsgate, and Aldersgate. There was also before the
Great Fire a church similarly dedicated at Billingsgate, and a
water-gate, called Buttolph's gate (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vide</i> Stow).</p>

<p>I can hardly imagine that this is merely a coincidence, and should be
glad to know whether any explanation can be given of it.</p>

<h4>
<span>Which are the Shadows?</span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 281.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;An extract from the
<cite>Memoirs of Wordsworth</cite>, vol. ii. p. 273., will throw some little light
on J. C. R.'s perplexities:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "The anecdote of the saying of the monk, in sight of Titian's
   picture, was told me in this house (Rydal Mount) by Mr. Wilkie,
   and was, I believe, first communicated to the world in this poem,
   the former portion of which I was composing at the time ('Lines
   suggested by a Portrait by F. Stone, 1834'). Southey heard the
   story from Miss Hutchinson, and transferred it to the <em>Doctor</em>;
   my friend Mr. Rogers, in a note <em>subsequently</em> added to his
   <cite>Italy</cite>, speaks of the same remarkable words having many years
   before been spoken in his hearing by a monk or priest in front of
   a picture of the Last Supper, placed over a refectory table in a
   convent at Padua."</p>

<p>It is much to be feared that this goes far towards reducing "the mild
Jeronymite's" remark to the established order of <em>stereotype</em>. On which
supposition, one need not wonder that&mdash;</p>

<span>Nightingale and Thorn</span>
<span> (Vol. iv., pp. 175. 242.; Vol. v., pp. 39.

</h4>

<p>&mdash;Is it known to your correspondents who take an interest in this
subject, that the nightingale, when she builds her nest, <em>inserts a
thorn about an inch long in the centre of it</em>, probably to lean her
breast against.</p>

<p>During my angling excursions I often get comfortably housed at a little
farmer's in Berks, and<a id="Page_476"></a> <span class="pagenum">[476]</span> in conversation with him, about two years
ago, relative to the habits of the nightingale, he mentioned this
peculiarity, adding that he carried a nest home with a thorn an inch
long built strongly through the middle of it. I recollected at the time
the subject had been treated by some of our poets, but was not aware
that it had any practical applicability.</p>

<p>In Berkshire they say of the nightingale's plaintive ditty:</p>

(Cork) is in error when he asserts that the above-named office does not
belong to female majesty.</p>

<p>Among the collection of pictures at Montreal, in Kent, is a portrait
which was purchased at the sale at Strawberry Hill, in 1842, on the back
of which is the following inscription in the handwriting of Horace
Walpole:</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "Lady Elizabeth Percy, only daughter and heiress of Josceline,
   last Earl of Northumberland. She was first married to Henry
   Holles Cavendish, Lord Ogle, only son of Henry, Duke of
   Newcastle. 2ndly, To Thomas Thynne, Esquire, who was murdered by
   Count Konismark. And, lastly, to Charles Seymour Duke of

introduced, as I said before, among the "pr√¶clarissim√¶ affinitates." The
arms of Strongbow, Earl of Pembroke, are brought into the shield of
quarterings through the well-known line of Marshall, De Braose,
Cantelupe, La Zouche, and thence through Burdet and Ashbye; nor, with
the exceptions of the last three, is there much mention of each family,
but merely what is necessary to show their descent.</p>

<p>&mdash;You might have added to your list
of editions of this work, one printed at New York in 1840, a number of
copies of which have been recently sent to this country. The title is
<cite>The Book of Jasher, referred to in Joshua and Second Samuel, faithfully
translated from the Original Hebrew</cite>, 8vo. pp. 267. It was published
with the recommendations of many learned men in America, one of which by
Prof. Noah, who appears to be the translator, I think worth extracting
as giving some idea of the character of the book:&mdash;</p>

 <p>  "Without giving it to the world as a work of divine inspiration,
   or assuming the responsibility to say that it is not an inspired
   book, I have no hesitation in pronouncing it a work of great
   antiquity and interest, and a work that is entitled, even
   regarding it as a literary curiosity, to a great circulation
   among those who take pleasure in studying the Scriptures."</p>

<p>I have read this book formerly. It is the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeu d'esprit</i> of an
unbeliever. The drift of it is, to present a cotemporary naturalist
account of the Mosaic and Josuetic histories, in opposition to the
supernatural histories in the Bible. But I remember seeing announced
among the intended publications of the Oriental Translation Fund, the
"Book of Jasher." That proves a work, so entitled, to exist in some
oriental language. What has become of that manuscript; and why was the
translation of it never printed, as promised? I have long wished to

<h4>
<span>Daniel De Foe</span>
<span> (Vol. v., p. 392.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Your correspondent, on referring to
Wilson's <cite>Life of De Foe</cite> (vol. iii. p. 648.), will find some mention of
John Joseph De Foe, his unfortunate great-grandson (not grandson), who
was executed at Tyburn, January 2, 1771. In the <cite>Sessions Papers for
1770-1</cite> (p. 25.), he will also find the trial of John<a id="Page_477"></a> <span class="pagenum">[477]</span> Clark and
John Joseph Defoe, otherwise Brown, otherwise Smith, for the robbery, on
the King's highway, of Alexander Fordyce, Esq. There seems to have been
no distinct identification of De Foe as one of the parties committing
the robbery; but in those days juries did not stand upon trifles, and he
had but little grace accorded to him. He was probably the grandson of
Daniel's second son, Bernard Norton De Foe, the abused of Pope; but this
is not quite certain.</p>

<p>Of the descendant of Daniel De Foe, who lived in or adjoining Hungerford
Market, your correspondent will also find mention in Wilson (vol. iii.
p. 649.). In all probability there are many descendants of this great
man now living in this country or abroad.</p>

<p>Your correspondent is under a mistake as to Robert Drury's Journal. The
first edition of that work, which I have now before me, came out in
1729, and therefore could not have been made use of by De Foe in writing
<cite>Robinson Crusoe</cite>, published ten years before. How far Drury's Journal
is true or fictitious, and by whom it was written, are curious
questions; but to attempt their solution would be out of place in this
reply.</p>

<h4>
<span>Buro, Berto, Beriora</span>
<span> (Vol. v., p. 395.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;A satisfactory explanation
of these three words is much to be desired, as they have puzzled the
antiquary, the linguist, and the classical scholar for nearly forty
years. They remind me of a similar case I met with in my reading not
long ago. The word <i lang="syc" xml:lang="syc">Ilpadelt</i>, painted on the windows of the church of
the Celestines at Marconcies, was the puzzle of all that read it, till
one day a Turk, who had received baptism, and was in the suite of
Francis I., came to Marconcies in the year 1523, and discovered that the
word was <em>Syriac</em>, and that it meant "God is my hope;" which explanation
was registered in the abbey library. These words had been the motto of
John de Montaign, who had founded the abbey, and enriched it with many
valuable treasures, according to a vow he had made during the sickness
of Charles VI.</p>

<p>However, if it will not disconcert the learned, I will, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">audax omnia
perpati</i>, venture upon a conjecture as to the meaning of these hidden
words. Ought not the first letters, thought to be <em>Bu</em>, in reality to be
read <em>Pro</em>? in which case the legend will be <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pro Roberti Beri ora</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</i> pray for Robert Berry; and the ring will be a mourning ring.</p>

<p>While on this subject, I may add that the inscribed rings, commonly
called <em>talismanic</em> or <em>cabalistic</em> rings, are improperly so designated.
The Latin term is much more appropriate, "annuli vertuosi." Perhaps
<em>mystical</em> might be a suitable name.</p>

correspondent, who inquires whether there are any persons named <em>Devil</em>,
I beg to say that there is (or was, two years since) a person of that
name, a labouring man, residing in the hamlet of Aston, in the parish of
Hope, Derbyshire. Whether there are more of the name living there, I am
unable to state; but I remember distinctly hearing of one, and the name
being so peculiar, fixed itself in my memory.</p>

<span>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</span>
</h3>


<p>There can be little doubt that the beneficent intentions which prompted
the late Earl of Bridgewater to bequeath 8000<i>l.</i> for the production of
a work <cite>On the Power, Wisdom, and Goodness of God, as manifested in the
Creation</cite>, were fully realised, when the late Mr. Davies Gilbert, the
then President of the Royal Society,<a id="Page_478"></a> <span class="pagenum">[478]</span> to whom the duty of carrying
out such intentions was allotted, did, with the assistance of the
Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of London, select for that
purpose the very eminent men to whom the world is indebted for the now
well-known series of books entitled <cite>The Bridgewater Treatises</cite>. And
there can be as little doubt that the republication, in a more popular
form, of these Essays, written by men most eminent for their scientific
attainments, and for the noble purpose of proving the consistency of the
works with the Word of God, is a still further carrying out of the
original intentions of the testator. We are therefore glad to see that
they are to form a portion of Bohn's <cite>Scientific Library</cite>. The first
volume&mdash;being the first also of the Rev. W. Kirby's Treatise <cite>On the
History, Habits, and Instincts of Animals</cite>, revised by Professor Rymer
Jones, who has added a few notes to the text explanatory of omissions
and errors incidental to the condition of zoological knowledge at the
time of its publication, and with the addition of many new woodcuts&mdash;has
just been issued, and is destined, we trust, to be circulated throughout
the whole length and breadth of the land.</p>

<p>Our readers who take an interest in the literature of Germany will be
pleased to hear that the <cite>Deutsches W√∂rterbuch</cite> of the Brothers Grimm,
the announcement of which fourteen years since created so much
excitement, is at press, and that the first portion of it may very
shortly be expected in this country. From the specimen which has been
forwarded to us by Messrs. Williams and Norgate, we think we may safely
assure our readers that, while on the one hand the work will be found
such as to do justice to the well-known acquirements of its
distinguished authors, it will not be found to be so overlaid with
learning as to be only fit for the use of profound philologists.</p>

<p>Messrs. Murray and Longman continue stedfast in their good work of
supplying the still increasing demand for works of real value at
moderate prices. The <cite>Reading for the Rail</cite> has, since we last called
attention to the series, been enriched with James's <cite>Fables of √Üsop</cite>,
with one hundred original and beautiful woodcuts designed by John
Tenniel; with the <cite>Sketch of Theodore Hook</cite>, from which we quoted in our
last Number; and with an admirable collection of stories of naval
heroism, under the title of <cite>Deeds of Naval Daring</cite>.</p>

<p>Messrs. Longman, on the other hand, have added to their <cite>Traveller's
Library</cite> one of the most interesting and curious books of travels in
Africa ever given to the public, we allude to Ferdinand Werne's <cite>Feldzug
nach Taka</cite>, the merits of which were recently pointed out in
<cite>Blackwood's Magazine</cite>, and which Mr. Johnston has well translated,
under the title of <cite>African Wanderings; or an Expedition to Taka, Basa,
and Beni-Amer, with a Particular Glance at the Races of Bellad Sudan</cite>. A
more interesting book for the traveller, or the stayer at home, we have
not met with for some time.</p>
